# DSA_Amazon_Product_Review_Analysis
This is my first project under the DSA Data Analysis program. Here, I am a Junior Data Analyst at RetailTech Insights, a company that provides e-commerce analytics solutions to sellers on platforms like Amazon.  My team has been tasked with analyzing product and customer review data to generate insights for Amazon.
